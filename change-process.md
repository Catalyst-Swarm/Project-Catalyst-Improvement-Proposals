# Process

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important** - If the community wants to make many improvements to the Project Catalyst ecosystem the process will need to be documented. This is an initial suggested process for making Project Catalyst improvements but is open to alternative approaches suggested by the community and can evolve over time.
{% endhint %}

The following details how the community can create an improvement proposal, submit and finalise that proposal and then have community governance decide whether that improvement gets accepted or rejected.

Check out the [voting tool resources](voting-tool-resources.md) for why the tools used below were selected.

## Process

**1. Draft improvement proposal**

Create a document to share with the community that includes:

* **Problem** - A short description of the problem being solved
* **Solution** - A short summary of what the solution will be
* **Vote** - Where the community should go to vote on the proposal
* **Research and analysis** - Detail out the required research and analysis made that lead to this improvement proposal. Explanations should include more details of the problems, potential solutions and any longer term implications of the improvement.

**2. Share for feedback**

Share the proposal within the community to get feedback. Some suggested places can be after town halls, Saturday Swarm sessions or Discord community chats.

**3. Finalise improvement proposal**

Finalise the proposal by adding it to the improvement proposals list and ensure a voting link is provided. 

**4. Governance with community**

Share in the town hall for the community to vote on the improvement proposal and give 7 days for community to vote.

**5. Tally votes**

Votes are tallied and audited by members of Catalyst Circle.

**6. Execution**

If the improvement proposal is accepted the Catalyst Circle can endorse and promote the improvement within the community.

## Auditability

How will the governance process be audited so it is fair and transparent to the community?

* Voters will need to have a Google account to vote \(helps to prevent spam\)
* Voters will add their full name and email address to the form
* At least one Catalyst Circle member from the community and one IOHK should be added as collaborators on the Google form so they can audit the responses
* The results will be attached to the improvement proposal once voting is finished

**Important** - This process is a short term solution and the community should be fully aware it is not perfect. When Atala Prism is available a better approach with a custom solution can be developed and then used.
