# Voting Tool Resources

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important** - This is a short term tool selected to initiate improvements to the Project Catalyst ecosystem. Other tools may be more suitable and can be recommended by the community!
{% endhint %}

**Suggested tool**

[Google Forms](https://google.co.uk/forms/about)

* Free
* Easy to add a comment question to get more voter feedback
* Results can be shown immediately to the voters if desired
* Can request google account is used as a form of identity to help prevent illegitimate voting

Google forms is not the perfect solution however it provides the key functionality required so the community can quickly and efficiently gather votes to initiate an improvement within Project Catalyst.

**Longer term solution**

In the future Atala Prism will allow us to migrate away from any centralised solution by allowing the community to sign their votes using their own identity wallet. 

Along with this the community can explore requirements for the community to vote. An example that could be trialled is having a proof of human credential which is issued by trusted community projects who vet people who want to vote or usage of some other reputation based system as a requirement.
